## Introduction<a name="section11660541593"></a>

Distributed Scheduler is used for cross-device component management. It allows the local device to access or control remote components, and enables app collaboration in distributed scenarios. Its main functions are as follows:

-   Remote ability startup: Starts an ability on a remote device.
-   Remote ability migration: Migrates an ability to a remote device.
-   Remote ability binding: Binds an ability on a remote device.
